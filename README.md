# Scope
A [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com) solo learning project to create a "Digital Business Card" static website with React.

Based on the lesson's included [Figma Design](https://scrimba.com/links/figma-digital-business-card-sp), I decided to create a FlyByWire Simulations inspired "About Me" card representative of the "core" team responsibilities a team member might hold.

Utilizes appropriate branding from FlyByWire Simulations and for fun includes the carried roles icons by a team member (i.e. Me) on the community Discord.
